# Esurance
  Sorry I did so poorly on this interview. <br>
  I made a React/Redux app where you can search by language to find better answers to the questions I stumbled over earlier today. 

# How to: 
* Clone repo 
* Navigate into the abetterresponse folder
* Enter $json-server --watch db.json to start your json server on localhost:3000 !important
* Enter $npm start to start the server for the react app 
* Check out my upgraded interview
